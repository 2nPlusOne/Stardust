In a far and distant galaxy, 
from your telescope you
admire the beauty of a 
starry nebula. As you gaze 
upon it in all its vastness, 
you see a strange sight.
Two planets collide, assuring
their mutual destruction.

Out of the chaos, you notice
a modicum of ejected mass 
puttering about through the 
great mess with the help 
of a small engine.
As the meager lump expertly 
dodges and weaves through 
its environment, collecting 
bits of stardust much smaller 
than itself, you wonder... 

What is it doing out there?

Everpresent by its side is 
a modest spacecraft, neither
helping nor hindering it, 
appearing to simply observe, 
just as you are.

As you continue to watch,
you see...
