Playing as a rocket-propulsed asteroid flying amidst the wreckage of a planetary collision, your goal is to collect mass and grow. Watch out though, because colliding with things too large can be dangerous! As you gain mass, you will need to collect metal particulates to upgrade your engine. Engine upgrades improve your maneuverability and speed.
